Things that won't be done during the hackathon, but should be eventually:

1) Smarter matrix inversions and determinant calculations using special structure, or, barring that, do something smarter than inverting matrices.
2) Bayes Factors instead of P-values, Could do 4-D integration, but probably can analytically get one more of the params out of there.
3) Be smarter about the l bounds we're giving to minimize
